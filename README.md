# Affirmation

## Pre-setp
First, I found a dataset online containing affirmations from 9 different topics from Kaggle. Then, I parsed through the data, getting the lists of raw affirmations in order to use them in the javascript.

## Components
First, I created a main page. This page just had the buttons that listed the possible topics you could get affirmations from. Then, I created a javascript file containing a list of all the variables I would need to use. On a click of the button, the program would simply pick a random affirmation from the user's chosen topic, and then save the data, and redirect to another html page where the saved affirmation would be displayed.
